CIT Smart Gate Pass Automated Student Entry-Exit and Outing Management System

This project is a technology-driven solution designed to automate and improve campus gate pass management at Coimbatore Institute of Technology. It streamlines how students enter/exit the campus and request permissions for outings or home leave, eliminating the inefficiencies of manual paper registers.

Key Components:

index.html:
Responsive web front-end presenting the project concept, features, solution details, team information, and tech stack. It outlines the real-world problem, highlights proposed technical features (barcode entry, automated notifications, dashboards), and explains how the solution creates a smarter, safer campus.

main.py:
Core backend logic written in Python, handling student records, entry/exit gate logs, and outing permissions. Using SQLite, it:

Tracks student movement with barcoded IDs.

Allows students to request outing permissions.

Lets wardens approve/reject requests.

Logs entries/exits and sends alerts for unauthorized or delayed returns.

Supports role-based commands and full database viewing.

review.pptx:
Project presentation summarizing the initial problem (manual gate pass), project motivation, solution overview, critical features, budgeting, timeline, team roles, and expected impact (queue reduction, enhanced safety, improved transparency, eco-friendliness).

Features:

Automated student check-in/out via barcoded ID scan.

Outing/home-leave requests and approvals managed digitally.

Real-time status tracking and instant SMS/email alerts to guardians if students are late/no-show.
